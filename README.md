## Introduction 👇
> Rezervoo is convenience through technology. 

From having a cozy brunch at your favourite bistro to a wild night out with your squad, Rezervoo has your back.


## Development Setup 👨‍💻

```
git clone https://github.com/kyokidG/rezervoo-place-client.git
yarn install install
yarn run dev
```

## Build ⚒
```
yarn run build
```

Built files are meant to be served over an HTTP server and you can use [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) for that. Opening index.html over file:// won't work.
